# llm_backend_go
This is a test library to build the llm applications on rust for speed. Frontend will be based using NextJS and Backend written in Go, Typescript and python
Go mostly for the heavy lifting.

## Go: will be used to write the manager which

## Backend:
   * llm_backend
    django-admin startproject llm_backend

## Frontend
   * Drag and Drop Files to build the embeddings.
   * Pop appearing features to give suggestions.
     * NextJS (Drag and Drop to get the file upload and the AI Company:
     * ) --> how to 

## Features to be added: 
   * OCR pdf --> send to Go Backend run llm.
   * Check projects for Retrieval Augmented Information.
   * Implementation Retrieval Augmented Generation.

## Goal of This Backend:
   * Supabase
   * Rust, No Third Party Applications connected to it.
   * Prove hallucination solved

## API Endpoints:
   * 

## Pitch on Tech:
   * Rust Backend, end to end solutions. 
     User friendly API
     user privacy
     No hallucination from the AI Agent.

## Pitch on Product:
   * Netflix Subscription churn prediction, automate sending personalised mails. a/B testing
   * Find, contact, and close your ideal buyers with over 265M contacts and streamlined engagement workflows powered by AI.
